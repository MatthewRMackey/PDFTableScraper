You are tasked with gathering all data from the given input text where each collected data value must have a description, unit of measure, and be associated with a year. The output should be a comma separated table with columns that follow this format adding columns for each year only as necessary: description ,unit ,2019, 2020, etc. Remove or replace all commas before inserting into the table. If the table entry does not have numerical data for the corresponding value, put N/A in its spot. Note that there may be more one set of data to be collected per input, but they should be combined into a single output table. If there are rows with space or tab indentions, treat those as sub-categories of the un-indented row by prepending the unindented description when adding the subrow to the table after the unindented row. The specific data that should be collected must match the sentiment of these following keywords: sustainability, scope 1, scope 2, scope 2, ghg, emissions, NOx, SOx, VOC, co2e. Any data not related to these keywords may be excluded. If there is no data in the text that follows the described table format, reply "False" without any additional comment.
